Machine learning is behind chatbots and predictive text, language translation apps, the shows Netflix suggests to you, and how your social media feeds are presented. It powers autonomous vehicles and machines that can diagnose medical conditions based on images.

When companies today deploy artificial intelligence programs, they are most likely using machine learning. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.

**What is machine learning?**

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.

Machine learning starts with data. The data is gathered and prepared to be used as training data, or the information the machine learning model will be trained on. The more data, the better the program. From there, programmers choose a machine learning model to use, supply the data, and let the computer model train itself to find patterns or make predictions.

Some data is held out from the training data to be used as evaluation data, which tests how accurate the machine learning model is when it is shown new data. The result is a model that can be used in the future with different sets of data.

The function of a machine learning system can be descriptive, meaning that the system uses the data to explain what happened; predictive, meaning the system uses the data to predict what will happen; or prescriptive, meaning the system will use the data to make suggestions about what action to take. 

There are **three subcategories** of machine learning:

- **Supervised machine learning** models are trained with labeled data sets, which allow the models to learn and grow more accurate over time. For example, an algorithm would be trained with pictures of dogs and other things, all labeled by humans, and the machine would learn ways to identify pictures of dogs on its own. Supervised machine learning is the most common type used today.
- **Unsupervised machine learning**, a program looks for patterns in unlabeled data. Unsupervised machine learning can find patterns or trends that people arenâ€™t explicitly looking for. For example, an unsupervised machine learning program could look through online sales data and identify different types of clients making purchases.
- **Reinforcement machine learning** trains machines through trial and error to take the best action by establishing a reward system. Reinforcement learning can train models to play games or train autonomous vehicles to drive by telling the machine when it made the right decisions, which helps it learn over time what actions it should take.

It takes a strong focus on statistical, mathematical and problem solving skills to get ahead in the field of Machine Learning.
